                           <div class="event-description">
                              <p>
                              </p>
                              <p>Hinduism essentially was originated not as a religious system but a regulated way of life which over the years, has transformed into religious concepts. Holy books such as Vedas, Upanishads, and Puranas which have been meant mainly for the betterment of the life of the people have enlightened many practitioners. The idea of God in Hinduism is mainly connected with natural powers like Agni (fire), Vayu (wind), and Varuna (water). It is believed that life exists in three stages i.e. birth, life, and death, and this belief comes from the concept of “Trimurti” or “Three-forms” (including Gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh). The most authentic texts of Hinduism are in the form of four Vedas i.e. the Sama Veda, the Rig Veda, the Atharva Veda, and the Yajur Veda. Hinduism is not only a religious concept but a philosophical approach to life.

                               <h2 class="uppercase"><a href="#" title="Spacial Monazat">The Key Principles, Beliefs, and Concepts of Hinduism</a></h2>
                              <p>In the Hindu value system, more importance is believed to be given to the evolution of the individual mind and personality than the faith or religion one perceives. It is thereby considered the most secular religion in the world due to the importance it gives to the values present in all religions. Additionally, it provides complete freedom of belief, worship, and way of life by choosing different spiritual paths. Moreover, the set of major rules for “better living” or “Dharmic” living that are created constitute the Hindu religion as a whole. Interestingly, it is considered both a religion and a way of life.  </p>
                             
                              <p>Some of the known beliefs ingrained in the concept of Hinduism are as follows:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li><b>Dharma:</b> Hinduism populates the fact that every human being is born with certain duties, rules, and obligations, and when these duties are fulfilled by the person, everyone benefits. Collectively, when everyone submits to their dharma then the society as a whole flourishes.</li>
                                  <li>Karma: Among Hindus, one of the most shared beliefs is the concept of karma which says that the consequences of past actions are reflected in the present circumstances.  It is connected to the concept of reincarnation i.e. the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. According to Hinduism, if a person’s intentions, thoughts, and deeds are good and positive, the soul reaps positive results. It is believed that when a person carries good karma in life, then the person is reborn in a better living situation in the next life. </li>
                                 <li>Moksha: In Hindu philosophy, Moksha is the liberation or soul’s release from the universal process of death and rebirth. </li>
                                  <li>Brahman: The idea of Brahman is exclusive to Hinduism and has not been found in any other religion. Brahman is considered to be the transcendent origin of all things. </li>
                                 <li>Yamas: Yamas, usually, refers to a person’s overall behavior and nature in daily life that includes honesty, compassion, and truthfulness. Hindus practice Raja Yoga to achieve liberation from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. The most significant Yama is considered to be non-violence which forms the base of all other Yamas. </li>
                                 <li>Niyamas: Niyamas are considered to improve a person’s karma when added with the code of personal behaviors in the Yamas. Niyama is a way of showing modesty and the idea of giving to others.</li>
                                 <p>Thus, Hinduism gives more weightage to the values that one carries and the process by which an individual evolves than to the image of God in one’s mind. It is thereby, considered to be the most secular religion along with Buddhism in the world because of the importance it attaches to the good value systems in all religions that are generally considered to be the ‘Core Values of Hinduism’.</p>
